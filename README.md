## General Information

---

This is a simple MERN application to track user exercises. It's a helpful app for tracking (exercises or otherwise) and was intended for me to continue to work on my fullstack building. It is also an attempt for me to learn Authentiation.

## Setup

---

What are the project requirements/dependencies? Where are they listed? A requirements.txt or a Pipfile.lock file perhaps? Where is it located?

Proceed to describe how to install / setup one's local environment / get started with the project.

### Run Locally

1. Clone repo locally
2. Run `npm install` in your bash/command line in the main project folder
3. Run `npm start` in your bash/command line in the UI folder
4. Open [http://localhost:4040](http://localhost:4040) to view it in the browser.
5. Run `npm run dev` in your bash/command line in the API folder
6. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### Available Commands

In the project directory, you can run:

`"npm start" : "react-scripts start"`,

The app is built using `create-react-app` so this command Runs the app in Development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. You also need to run the server file as well to completely run the app. The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

`"npm run dev": "concurrently "nodemon server" "npm run start"`,

For running the server and app together I am using nodemon concurrently, this helps a lot in the MERN application as it runs both the server (client and server) concurrently. So you can work on them both together.
